# Virtual Fruit Machine
Phorest Graduate Programme – Technical Challenge<br><br>
As required, I created a virtual fruit machine that allows a user to start playing with 50 coins to win a jackpot of 500 coins when the colours in each slot are the same.  It also shows messages to tell the user if they won or lost, and it shows that the money in the machine increases/decreases.
<br><br>The first step was to set up a index.html file to hold the layout for the JavaScript coding using VSCode, so it could be opened by its Live Server extension. 
<br><br>With JavaScript, I created the necessary code to display the slot machine on the web client. I managed to:
-	Create elements to contain game content, information element, button for interaction and main content element,
-	Add event listener to the button for the user to press 
-	Toggle button content invoke function on button click
-	Create and launch game board makers when DOM is loaded
-	Create function to handle making elements for the page
-	Apply styling to elements to centre and position on the page
-	Add animation frame
-	Interaction with button to stop and start animation frames
-	Also used CSS to apply few styles to the page elements

The code has been commented so it makes it easier to understand and follow the creation process. 
I’ve attempted to perform unit Automated Tests using NodeJS (NPM) and Jest, also Leapwork. 
However, because of my lack of hands-on experience with Automated Tests I wasn’t able to get a satisfactory result in time, so I decided not to share.
<br><br>I believe I learned even more about Automated Tests and JavaScript just during the creation of this project, and I would love to keep developing 
my skills at Phorest.
